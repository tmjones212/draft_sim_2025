- when the app first starts, before we pick a draft slot, let's have a banner in the middle somewhere that says "CHOOSE A DRAFT SPOT"
- the roster section is terrible. dont show players at the same position horizontally. show them below (e.g., show the 2nd WR below your first WR)

- i would like there to be a little ? icon on each player in the available players icon we can click on that loads a little player card that shows their stats by week (last year / 2024 only, not projected by week)

-let's add the concept of "Templates". a template is basically just saving the state of a draft so we can load it later. so we need a dropdown to load existing templates, and a way to save teh current state to a template (and name it). the template needs to know what pick number we are, whose pick it is, manual vs. simmed draft (non-manual), the players that have been taken, etc. basically the whole state of the draft
    - make tests so we're sure this is working


- the other 9 teams in my league are:
Luan, Joey, Jerwan, Karwan, Johnson, Erich, Stan, Pat, Peter. After I pick my team, change the name of the other 9 teams to one of these (randomly, and don't reuse obviously)
