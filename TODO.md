- if i click on a pick that's already been made, revert the pick back to that draft (meaning that pick and every pick after that until it's my turn again)
- i also need an "undo" button in case I hit that on accident
- the computer simulated teams should try to be smart about their roster construction. meaning:
    - they won't draft more players at a position than they can start so < 3 QBs, < 5 WR's, etc.
    - TE's are a special case, nobody will draft more than 1 TE
- don't just blindly do the 70% 25% 5% thing you're doing. look at the ADP of the available players compared to the pick you're at now. obviously if its pick 50, and one guy has an ADP of 45 and the next best is 53, you need to be significantly more likely to pick the 45 ADP guy. compared to if the best available is 50, and there are 12 guys that are 51, then you shouldn't necessarily pick the best guy nearly as often
