i'd like to be able to right click on a player already drafted, and there be an optoin for "Change Pick", and when you hover, it shows a list of the next 5 players sorted on ADP (that haven't been drafted yet) and if I pick one, it replaces taht pick w/ the player I selected
Make sure remove the new player from the available players table and put the old one back in there
