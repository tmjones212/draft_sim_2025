i'd like to be able to right click on a player already drafted, and there be an optoin for "Change Pick", and when you hover, it shows a list of the next 5 players sorted on ADP (that haven't been drafted yet) and if I pick one, it replaces taht pick w/ the player I selected
Make sure remove the new player from the available players table and put the old one back in there


I'd like to be able draft from the Game History tab (we can right click -> Draft Player)
The "Show Available" checkbox isn't workgin on the Game History tab. I click it, and all the players that have already been drafted are still there

When you click the "?" for the weekly stats of a player, make the window taller, we can only see week 1-10 without scrolling. I'd like to see them all
