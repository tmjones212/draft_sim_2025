- the background colors in the table for hte star and the draft button can still be wrong, like after i make 1 pick it's off by one row


- the app loads weirdly. it shows up on  the left side first, then centers. can we just not show it before its centered?
- when the app first starts, before we pick a draft slot, let's have a banner in the middle somewhere that says "CHOOSE A DRAFT SPOT"
- the roster section is terrible. dont show players at the same position horizontally. show them below (e.g., show the 2nd WR below your first WR)
