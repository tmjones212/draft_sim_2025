i need to be able to access this via my phone in the browser.
can you make a web version that I can access on my phone that has the main functionality of the draft page? dont worry about templates, i just need the functionality taht would be necessary to see the available players table, see the draft board, make picks, roll back picks

make sure you dont do anything that impacts the functionality we already have on the web version

and i need to a way to host this website for free so dont do anything thats gonna require me to spend money
i want to use azure static pages or something
