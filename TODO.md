- the table view isn't updating when players are drafted
- the table isn't sortable when i click the headers like it should be
- the "control" is terrible. dont call it contorl. call it "Sit". and make the text white
- and the team you are controlling, that header is too bright. all the greens are too bright
- i want to be able to drag between the draft board and the table below to make them bigger/smaller

Here are some nicknames i want to use when displaying on the draft board (dont actually change their names, just show it this way visually in the app)
BRIAN THOMAS,BTJ
AMON RA ST BROWN, SUN GOD
JUSTIN JEFFERSON, JJ
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY, CMC
JOHNATHAN TAYLOR, JT
JAYDEN DANIELS, JD
BIJAN ROBINSON, BIJAN
