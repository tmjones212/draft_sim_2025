- the sorts are extremely slow. they weren't like that earlier
- the background colors in the table for hte star and the draft button can still be wrong, like after i make 1 pick it's off by one row
- put the whole good value fair value thing at the top right above the draft board (in the empty space to the right of the round and pick number and the on the clock team x thing).
-  restart draft button is a disaster. many of the picks aren't gone from the draft board. its extremely slow
