- the background colors in the table for hte star and the draft button can still be wrong, like after i make 1 pick it's off by one row


- the app loads weirdly. it shows up on  the left side first, then centers. can we just not show it before its centered?
- when the app first starts, before we pick a draft slot, let's have a banner in the middle somewhere that says "CHOOSE A DRAFT SPOT"
- the roster section is terrible. dont show players at the same position horizontally. show them below (e.g., show the 2nd WR below your first WR)
- i want you to write some tests that make a bunch of picks, rolls back some picks, over and over, and makes sure that the available players table (both the actual data and the display) only show players that are ACTUALLY available.
