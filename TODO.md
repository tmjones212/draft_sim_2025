- on game history tab when i start typying to search it keeps popping up "please select a player to draft" for some reason
- also RB1, RB2, etc. are not positions. its just the top row, ALL, QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX
- can we hide the irrelvant columns like pass yards when we're showing WR's only (assuming there's nothing to show), receptions for QBs, etc?
- the Rush TD's show negative numbers for a lot of players... that doesn't make sense
- on game history add buttons to switch between summarized and detailed views, basically group it by year and week
- for the Team in the available players table, let's put the team logos instead
-the ADP header doesn't quite fit in the available players table
- get rid of the draft button on each row of the table and just add a right click draft option. that combined w/ our double click draft we already have should be enough
-by default only show the first 3 rounds in teh draft table and make the available players table taller
- the header is too tall like where the undo, restart draft etc. buttons are. thats too tall let's make it a little smaller so everything else has more vertical space
- When you learn useful things that would be helpful in the future, memorialize them in CLAUDE.md
