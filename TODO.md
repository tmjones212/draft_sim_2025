-let's add the concept of "Templates". a template is basically just saving the state of a draft so we can load it later. so we need a dropdown to load existing templates, and a way to save teh current state to a template (and name it). the template needs to know what pick number we are, whose pick it is, manual vs. simmed draft (non-manual), the players that have been taken, etc. basically the whole state of the draft
    - make tests so we're sure this is working


- the other 9 teams in my league are:
Luan, Joey, Jerwan, Karwan, Johnson, Erich, Stan, Pat, Peter. After I pick my team, change the name of the other 9 teams to one of these (randomly, and don't reuse obviously)

i want the ability to view and change a players ADP inside of the app

- game history (player details) should show home vs. away via the "vs" column, it should say "@ x" when they are on teh road and "vs x" when they are at home. Let me know if we dont have that data
- the week(s) they were on bye shouldn't show up for the game history log
- we need a column for their bye week in 2025 (this year) in the available players table (let me know if you can't find that data)
- game history table doesn't scroll when i use teh mouse wheel
- in the game history table the column headers need to be  click sortable w/ the little arrows
- add snap counts, the snap counts are in the {yyyy}_{week}_{position}.json files in scripts/stats_data under the "off_snp" key
