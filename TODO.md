when I'm looking at the player game stats by clicking the "?" icon, i want to be able to compare 2 players side by side
so when i click one, there should be a button or something that lets me pick who i want to compare with, and it should show their 2 player cards side by side
also add a Total row to teh bottom of the player card, make sure it's visible without scrolling. i dont even want the vertical scrollbar, we should just be able to see it all
