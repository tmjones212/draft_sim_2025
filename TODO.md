When you click the "?" for the weekly stats of a player, make the window taller, we can only see week 1-15 without scrolling. I'd like to see them all

- when i try to change a pick to a specific player, it isn't working. it just repicks from that pick and it could pick anyone (within the normal paramters) instead of who i tell it to pick.

when we look at the right click -> change pick menu, we actually need to see the next 10 players players with the lowest ADP that either (1) haven't been drafted yet or (2) were taken after this pick
-in non-manual mode, if we pick someone that has already been drafted, then let's redo the draft from that point, up until it's my turn to pick again
- in manual mode, if we pick someone that has already been drafted, we need to clear all picks after the player that was reused (and clear the original pick as well) and that should be the current pick.
