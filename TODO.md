 - can you add some tests like make some picks, revert some a bunch of times, make sure it doesn't always repick the same players, make sure it isn't taking too long, make sure it's putting the players, back into the available player pool, etc.? you'd have to run those on the windows version    
 - the bookmark stars and draft buttons get the wrong background color after picks are made
