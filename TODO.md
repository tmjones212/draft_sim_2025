- when the app first starts, before we pick a draft slot, let's have a banner in the middle somewhere that says "CHOOSE A DRAFT SPOT"
- the roster section is terrible. dont show players at the same position horizontally. show them below (e.g., show the 2nd WR below your first WR)

- i would like there to be a little ? icon on each player in the available players icon we can click on that loads a little player card that shows their stats by week (last year / 2024 only, not projected by week)
