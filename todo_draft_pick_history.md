i would like to be able to load up any previous draft that i've done in this app
so every pick made in the app (by me or auto picked) needs to be logged in a file somewhere
and when picks are rolled back / reverted, we need to can just overwrite (we dont need that level of history)
and i want to be able to load any draft we've previously had
so we need some beautiful way of doing this
give me away to name the draft i'm currently on (dont make it required though)
maybe in the space right after the column heaeders in the draft table i can pu tthe n ame
and there's a dropdown next to it to load any prior draft i've done

- also when I'm full on a position, the remaining players in the available playlers table of that position should have a little red X in the available players table somewhere, maybe after the "?" icon

so if i have 2 qbs already, all qb's in the table should have a little red X
dont forget that for flex, any RB WR or TE can go there so if there's an open flex spot, any of those are OK to put there

also i want to do something to indicate dangerous bye weeks
if I have one player taht is on bye week 6, I want the available players that are also on bye week 6 to have something indicating that
and if i already ahve 2 players on that bye wek, something else that i ndicates its worse
same with 3+

and on the roster pane let's show the bye weeks of the players
