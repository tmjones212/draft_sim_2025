i still dont see completions in player stats pop up when you click the ?.and the QB points are still low, i'm guessing they are missing completion points.
-the default sort on the available players table should be ADP. the rank should just be the rank of their VAR
-on game history for the Team column use the team image
-the points have to be off for QBs. josh allen week 3 it says 30.9 points. he had 4 TD's, thats 28, 44 rush yards that's 8.8. 23 completions th ats 23/2 points. make sure we're showing Comp as well in here 
  (and including them) put it before pass yards
- let's color code good and bad numbers in the game history pop up
- Good: Pass Yds >= 300, Completions >= 30, Pass TD's >= 3, Rush or Rec TD >= 1, Rush or Rec yards >= 90, for RB 40+ is good. for TE 50+ is good. for WR 6+ rec is good, for TE 5+, for RB 4+. QB rush yards >= 40 is good. for RB > 43 snaps is good, for a WR or TE >= 50 snaps is good
- Bad: Pass Yds < 250, Completions < 20, WR with Rec yards < 70. TE with rec yards < 50, RB with rush yards < 50. RB's with 2 or fewer catches is bad, for TE's <= 3 is bad. , QB rush yards < 20 is bad, for a QB < 50 snaps is bad, for a RB < 30 is bad, for a WR < 40 is bad

- i want a right click option on the Game History tab for "Add to Watchlist"
- the game history should have a way to click a button to show the projections (which uses the summarized view)
- add a way to filter on home games or away games
- game history page, the Opp needs to be @ {team_logo} (for a road game) or vs {team_logo} (for a home game).
on the player pop up game history page, the Opp needs to be @ {team_logo} (for a road game) or vs {team_logo} (for a home game).
